# Web-Crawling
As the part of NLP Semester Project "Language Generation Using RNNs and Transformers", first step was to acquire data using web crawling from government website.Here's the key points of what I did.
## Key Highlights:

- Used Library Beautiful Soup to crawl data from website "State Bank of Pakistan"
- Pre-processed the raw data by removing HTML tags, special characters, URLs, and redundant spaces using Regular Expressions (REGEX).
- Crawled Pages: 10 pages.

## Tools & Libraries Used:
- Pandas
- BeautifulSoup
- re (Regular Expressions)
- requests

## Output Deliverables:
- A CSV file with the cleaned content extracted from 10 pages.
- Original HTML files for each crawled page.
- Cleaned text files for each crawled page.
