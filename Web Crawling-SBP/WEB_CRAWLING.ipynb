     \"Departments Islamic Finance Development Department Islamic banking is known as a banking system based on the principles of Islamic Shariah In Pakistan the steps for the transformation of conventional banking and financial system into Islamic system were initiated in the 1980s Pakistan was among the few countries in the world that had been trying to implement interest free banking at a national level In the early 1980s numerous measures were taken to introduce interest free banking and different banking and other relevant laws were amended to facilitate an interest free banking system in the country Considering lessons learned from the earlier efforts Islamic banking in Pakistan was relaunched in 2001 when it was decided to promote Islamic banking in a gradual manner and as a parallel and compatible system in line with the best international practices Consequently the Islamic Banking Department IBD was established at the State Bank of Pakistan SBP with a mandate of developing and strengthening the regulatory and Shariah compliance framework for Islamic banking and taking initiatives for the promotion of the industry as a parallel and viable banking system Keeping in view the extensiveness of the transformation task SBP has modified its institutional arrangement for better prioritization of objectives and enhanced focus For this purpose a dedicated Islamic Finance Group has been established at SBP in December 2022 which comprises of two departments Islamic Finance Policy Department IFPD and Islamic Finance Development Department IFDD The primary objectives of IFDD include managing seminars or workshops to create market awareness about Islamic banking planning and executing capacity building sessions for stakeholders monitoring banks Islamic banking transformation plans facilitating the development of innovative products such as asset light Sukuk structures etc and strategic collaboration with domestic or international stakeholders in the area of Islamic finance The department is also responsible for strengthening the Islamic money market by addressing the liquidity management challenges of the Islamic banking industry This department also acts as a secretariat to the Steering Committee constituted by the Government of Pakistan to provide strategic guidance regarding the implementation of the Federal Shariat Court s judgement on riba Under this committee a committee for the transformation of conventional banking into Islamic banking along with several working groups and work streams have also been constituted to steer the transformation journey towards Islamic banking\",\n          \"Legal Framework SBP s Functions are mainly governed by SBP Act 1956 as amended up to 28 01 2022 Banking Companies Ordinance 196 2 Foreign Exchange Regulations Act 1947 Payment System and Electronic Fund Transfer Act 2007 Under the State Bank of Pakistan Order 1948 the Bank was charged with the duty to regulate the issue of Bank notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in Pakistan and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage The scope of the Bank s operations was considerably widened in the State Bank of Pakistan Act 1956 which required the Bank to regulate the monetary and credit system of Pakistan and to foster its growth in the best national interest with a view to securing monetary stability and fuller utilisation of the country s productive resources Under financial sector reforms the State Bank of Pakistan was granted autonomy in February 1994 On 21st January 1997 this autonomy was further strengthened by issuing three Amendment Ordinances which were approved by the Parliament in May 1997 namely State Bank of Pakistan Act 1956 Banking Companies Ordinance 1962 and Banks Nationalisation Act 1974 The changes in the State Bank Act gave full and exclusive authority to the State Bank to regulate the banking sector to conduct an independent monetary policy and to set limit on government borrowings from the State Bank of Pakistan The amendments in Banks Nationalisation Act abolished the Pakistan Banking Council an institution established to look after the affairs of NCBs and institutionalised the process of appointment of the Chief Executives and Boards of the nationalised commercial banks NCBs and development finance institutions DFIs with the Sate Bank having a role in their appointment and removal The amendments also increased the autonomy and accountability of the Chief Executives and the Boards of Directors of
